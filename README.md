#JavaScript Jukebox
   * You've had a bit of time to get familiar with object oriented JavaScript. Time to use that knowledge to make the coolest juke joint in the place!
   
   * Using any mp3 you can ﬁnd online, create a simple web page where you can play it. After this step, research which JavaScript functions can pause, play, and stop the Jukebox
   
   * Encapsulate all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling:
   
   *  Jukebox.play()
   
   
 # Grading Criteria

 ### Your JavaScript Jukebox must:
  
  * Display at least one song on the page when the page loads
  
  * Give the user the ability to play that song, without using the "built-in" play button. This could be through a diﬀerent
button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.
 
  * Give the user the ability to stop that song without using the "built-in" stop button. Once again, this could be through a diﬀerent button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.
  
  * Give the user the ability to load at least one diﬀerent song into the Jukebox besides the one that is loaded when the page initially renders
  
  * The whole Jukebox should be backed by an object called Jukebox with methods to play, stop, and load songs.


 ### Bonus Features:
 
  * Playlist of songs, allows the user to queue up the next song
 
  * Feature to request a random song
